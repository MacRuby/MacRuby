The HotCocoa directory contains examples for the MacRuby's HotCocoa
gem, which aims at making Cocoa development easier for Ruby
developers.

You will also find some standalone scripts in the Scripts directory. These
files are meant to be run from the command line.

Several DTrace scripts are available in the DTrace directory. These scripts
should be executed from the command line.
