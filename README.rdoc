== MacRuby

MacRuby is a Ruby implementation based on Mac OS X technologies, such as the 
Objective-C runtime and garbage collector, the CoreFoundation framework and the
LLVM compiler infrastructure.

It is the goal of MacRuby to enable the creation of full-fledged Mac OS X
applications which do not sacrifice performance in order to enjoy the benefits
of using Ruby.

=== Requirements

* An Intel 64-bit machine. PowerPC and Intel 32-bit machines are not supported
  anymore, but may still work.

* Mac OS X 10.6 or later.

* LLVM ToT, compiled for x86_64.

  LLVM is a moving target and breaks periodically. We recommend to install
  revision 127367 of branch 2.9, being sure to specify the correct C and
  C++ compilers through environment variables. 

    $ svn co https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/branches/release_29@127367 llvm-2.9
    $ cd llvm-2.9
    $ env CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ ./configure --enable-bindings=none --enable-optimized --with-llvmgccdir=/tmp
    $ env CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ make
    $ sudo env CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ make install

  Note that compiling LLVM can take quite a while. If you have a machine with
  multiple cores, which is quite likely, you might want to speed up the process
  by using all/more cores. However, doing this can make your machine
  unresponsive during compilation. To use multiple cores pass the `-j N'
  option, where `N' stands for the number of cores you'd like to use. So for a
  Core Duo the command would look like:

    $ env CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ make -j2

  If you would prefer to update an existing LLVM Subversion working copy you 
  need to be careful to remove any previous build files before you compile:

    $ svn status --no-ignore | awk '{print $2}' | xargs rm -rf
    $ svn revert -R .
    $ svn switch <repository-URL>

=== Build Instructions

You can build MacRuby by doing the following command:

  $ rake

Or, as with LLVM, you can specify the amount of jobs to run simultaneously:

  $ rake jobs=2

Once done, you can run the RubySpec-based regression tests as well as the
performance suite:

  $ rake spec:ci
  $ rake bench:ci

To install MacRuby on your machine:

  $ sudo rake install

Then you should be all set! Please report us any problem you will find (the
http://macruby.org website has pointers). Thanks!
